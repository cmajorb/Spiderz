      <p>Thanks for showing up! So there's some good news, along with some bad...
      <p>The good: You've been biomechanically upgraded to eight limbs (you're not just stuck with two lame legs now), and you no longer must endure the unnecessarily diverse palate of human nutriment. You eat bugs now.</p>
      <p>Now the bad: You're sharing your web with another arachnid; one that isn't too friendly. You've got to outmaneuver your opponent and claim your home (i.e. the center of the web) before it's too late!</p>
      <p>There's a catch though: You'll win if you're the only spider occupying the central area, but if both you and your opponent make it to the middle, whoever enters LAST is considered the winner. Don't get caught outside the center, but don't be the first to enter it either!</p>
      <p>Both you and your opponent will begin the match in one of the outermost sections of the web, and will take alternating turns to moving one space either forwards, backwards, left, or right, leaving behind a trail of sticky, colored thread (you're a mutant spider, after all). This sticky thread that you and your opponent are leaving behind is impenetrable--after moving, the area that was previously occupied can no longer be entered. In addition, some areas of the web are in disrepair and can't be navigated through, so you'll need to work around them. </p>
      <p>Welcome to Spiderz!</p>
